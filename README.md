> **End of support notice**: On October 31, 2025, AWS will discontinue support for Amazon Lookout for Vision. After October 31, 2025, you will no longer be able to access the Lookout for Vision console or Lookout for Vision resources. For more information, see [Exploring Alternatives to Lookout for Vision](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/exploring-alternatives-and-seamlessly-migrating-data-from-amazon-lookout-for-vision/).


[Amazon Lookout for Vision](https://aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-vision/) is a machine learning (ML) service that spots defects and anomalies in visual representations using computer vision (CV). With Amazon Lookout for Vision, manufacturing companies can increase quality and reduce operational costs by quickly identifying differences in images of objects at scale. For example, Amazon Lookout for Vision can be used to identify missing components in products, damage to vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, miniscule defects in silicon wafers, and other similar problems. Amazon Lookout for Vision uses ML to see and understand images from any camera as a person would, but with an even higher degree of accuracy and at a much larger scale. Amazon Lookout for Vision allows customers to eliminate the need for costly and inconsistent manual inspection, while improving quality control, defect and damage assessment, and compliance. In minutes, you can begin using Amazon Lookout for Vision to automate inspection of images and objects–with no machine learning expertise required.

### Architecture

This demo uses [Amazon Lookout for Vision](https://aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-vision) for image processing, [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito) for authenticating the Service Requests, [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) for the API, and [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3), [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify), and [React](https://reactjs.org) for the front-end layer.

</p>

When accessing the Demo, the frontend app calls the `ListProjects` API in Amazon Lookout for Vision. Then, for each project, it calls the `ListModels` API. This is for fetching the list and status of each model in the current account.

In addition to showing all the models, the UI allows to start all the models in the *TRAINED* or *STOPPED* state by calling the `StartModel` API.
The UI also allows to stop a model in the *HOSTED* state by calling the `StopModel` API.

If you have any model in the *HOSTED* state, you can click the title and then select an image from your local machine to detect anomalies. The frontend app will call the `DetectAnomalies` API in Amazon Lookout for Vision.

To learn more about Amazon Lookout for Vision [consult the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-vision).


### Usage

#### Prerequisites

To deploy the sample application you will require an AWS account. If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions. Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles.

To use the sample application you will require a [modern browser](https://caniuse.com/#search=FileReader%20API).

#### Deployment

The demo application is deployed as an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

1. Deploy the latest CloudFormation template by following the link below for your preferred AWS region:

|Region|Launch Template|
|------|---------------|
|**US East (N. Virginia)** (us-east-1) | [![Launch the LookoutVisionDemo Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=LookoutVisionDemo&templateURL=https://solution-builders-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-lookout-for-vision-demo/latest/template.yaml)|
|**US East (Ohio)** (us-east-2) | [![Launch the LookoutVisionDemo Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=LookoutVisionDemo&templateURL=https://solution-builders-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-lookout-for-vision-demo/latest/template.yaml)|
|**US West (Oregon)** (us-west-2) | [![Launch the LookoutVisionDemo Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=LookoutVisionDemo&templateURL=https://solution-builders-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-lookout-for-vision-demo/latest/template.yaml)|
|**EU (Ireland)** (eu-west-1) | [![Launch the LookoutVisionDemo Stack with CloudFormation](docs/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/new?stackName=LookoutVisionDemo&templateURL=https://solution-builders-eu-west-1.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-lookout-for-vision-demo/latest/template.yaml)|

2. If prompted, login using your AWS account credentials.
3. You should see a screen titled "*Create Stack*" at the "*Specify template*" step. The fields specifying the CloudFormation template are pre-populated. Click the **Next** button at the bottom of the page.
4. On the "*Specify stack details*" screen you may customize the following parameters of the CloudFormation stack:
   * **Stack Name:** (Default: *LookoutVisionDemo*) This is the name that is used to refer to this stack in CloudFormation once deployed. The value must be 15 characters or less.
   * **AdminEmail:** This is the e-mail address used to create the Admin User in the Cognito User Pool.
   * **ResourcePrefix:** (Default: *LVDemo*) AWS Resources are named based on the value of this parameter. You must customise this if you are launching more than one instance of the stack within the same account.
   * **CreateCloudFrontDistribution**  (Default: *true*) Creates a CloudFront distribution for accessing the web interface of the demo. This must be enabled if S3 Block Public Access is enabled at an account level. **Note:** Creating a CloudFront distribution may significantly increase the deploy time (from approximately 5 minutes to over 30 minutes).

   When completed, click **Next**
5. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) if desired, then click **Next**.
6. On the review you screen, you must check the boxes for:
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*" 
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names*"
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND*"

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create the IAM roles specified in the CloudFormation using both fixed and dynamic names.
7. Click **Create Change Set**
8. On the *Change Set* screen, click **Execute** to launch your stack.
   * You may need to wait for the *Execution status* of the change set to become "*AVAILABLE*" before the "**Execute**" button becomes available.
9. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when the "Stack status" is "*CREATE_COMPLETE*".
   * You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.
10. Note the *url* displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack. This is used to access the application.

#### Accessing and using the Demo

To use the Demo, you need models trained by Amazon Lookout for Vision. Consult the [Getting Started Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-vision/latest/developer-guide/what-is.html) to learn how to create and train an Amazon Lookout for Vision model.

Once deployed, the application can be accessed using a web browser using the address specified in `url` output from the CloudFormation stack created during [deployment](#deployment) of the solution.

When accessing the application for the first time, you need to use the Admin e-mail provided during Stack Creation as username. A temporary password will be sent to the same e-mail address. After authentication, it will be necessary to create a new password and click "Change".

To manage users, you can use the [Cognito Users Pool console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users).

### Removing the demo application

To remove the demo application, open the AWS CloudFormation Console, click the **LookoutVisionDemo** project then right-click and select "*Delete Stack*". Your stack will take some time to be deleted. You can track its progress in the "*Events*" tab. Once the stack deletion is complete, the status will change from "*DELETE_IN_PROGRESS*" to "*DELETE_COMPLETE*". It will then disappear from the list.
